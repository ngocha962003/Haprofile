If i have chance, i will visit Koera once. Korea has 3 things which make me want to visit there once. I have watched film of Korea for 6 years, every romantic film of Korea can make me cry such as "moon lovers", "boys overs flower" and so on, so i love film of Korea. That is the first reason i want to visit korea. Second, i really want to go to Busan city because there not only has a beautiful view but also has a lot of delicous food.
